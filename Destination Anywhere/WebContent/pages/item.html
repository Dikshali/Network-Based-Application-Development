						<div class="eventDetails">In the wake of World War One
							Germany was on its knees. Economic chaos in the early 1920s and
							'30s saw a massive increase in support for extremist parties. By
							1933 Adolf Hitler's National Socialist party had taken power in
							Germany. In the following 12 years the Nazis would create a
							system of terror, oppression, imprisonment, murder, and war that
							would bring death to millions of people worldwide in WWII. On
							this tour you'll cover not only the rise and fall of the Nazi
							party, but also the consequences of their actions. Starting from
							Hackescher Markt your guide will tell you the fate of Berlin's
							Jewish district, before taking you on a short train journey to
							what used to be the Nazi government district. There you'll
							explore the remains of Anhalter Bahnhof, once Europe's largest
							train station, used to send thousands of Jews to concentration
							camps. You'll then visit Heinrich Himmler's SS & Gestapo
							Headquarters and Herman Goring's Air Force ministry, before
							covering topics vital to understanding the Third Reich such as
							Joseph Goebbels' propaganda and the 'T4' euthanasia programme.

							Your tour will end at the Reichstag, where your guide will tell
							you about the final moments of WWII. From the Soviet assault on
							the parliament building in the Battle of Berlin, to the Fuhrer's
							suicide not even 1km away.</div>

						<div class="eventDetails">Journey into Aquaria, a watery
							wonderland right in the middle of Kuala Lumpur. Travel between
							dramatic and entertaining exhibits, surrounding yourself with
							tanks brimming with incredible creatures from the ocean deep,
							freshwater rivers, coastal tidelands, and even dense kelp
							forests. Enter Aquaria and traverse the aquarium's 2 levels,
							which feature 8 separate ecosystems with both marine life and
							coastal mammals. Learn the principles of evolution from the
							piranhas before meeting the small-clawed otters in the riverbank
							jungle. Journey out to sea to see a wrecked ship, where you
							marvel at colorful corals before touring an underwater kelp
							forest, a coastal mangrove forest, and the den of sharks in the
							living ocean. Your experience concludes in surreal weirdness in
							the glowing jelly fish tanks. Aquaria KLCC is a massive water
							world of natural exhibits, incorporating more than 5,000 exhibits
							over 60,000 square feet (5,500 sq m) in the heart of Kuala
							Lumpur. Despite its massive size, the oceanarium is easy to
							navigate thanks to a straightforward layout that builds
							foundational knowledge rather than overwhelming you with detail.
							This makes Aquaria perfect for children with an interest in the
							ocean and the world's many non-human inhabitants.</div>
